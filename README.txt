INTRODUCTION:

This module will help non-developers integrate Drupal with Inspectlet.com
Inspectled is a usability tool which can generate heatmaps and clickmaps.
It also records where the mouse is on the screen, so that site owners can become
aware which buttons and / or links people are hovering over but don't click.
For more information see: http://www.inspectlet.com/
